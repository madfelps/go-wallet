# go-wallet

This project was proposed by [Devgym](https://www.devgym.com.br/). 

The challenge proposes the creation of a REST API application for money transfer, where it must have an endpoint that receives two users id and a value representing the money transfer. However, race conditions issues should be carefully treated in case two persons transfer an amount of money to a third person on the same time. ðŸ¤‘
